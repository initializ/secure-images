The image is available on `public.ecr.aws`:

```
docker pull public.ecr.aws/t4s8c0c3/kubectl
```

## Usage

`kubectl` is a minimal secure image with no shell. You can use the image as follows:

```

docker run public.ecr.aws/t4s8c0c3/kubectl:latest help

```

You will see the results:

```
kubectl controls the Kubernetes cluster manager.

## Provenance

All Initializ Secure Images contain verifiable signatures and high-quality SBOMs (software bill of materials), features that enable users to confirm the origin of each image built and have a detailed list of everything that is packed within.

### Verifying Image Signatures 

The kubectl Initializ Secure Images are signed using Sigstore, and you can check the included signatures using cosign.

The following command requires [cosign](https://docs.sigstore.dev/cosign/overview/) and [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) to be installed on your machine. It will pull detailed information about all signatures found for the provided image.

```

cosign verify public.ecr.aws/t4s8c0c3/kubectl \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity https://github.com/initializ/secure-images/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main | jq

```

By default, this command will fetch signatures for the latest tag. You can also specify the tag you'd like to fetch signatures for.

### Downloading and Verifying SBOMs 

All Initializ Secure Images come with a high-quality Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) attested at build-time. The SBOM can be downloaded using the cosign tool:

```

cosign download attestation --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document \
  public.ecr.aws/t4s8c0c3/kubectl:latest | jq -r .payload | base64 -d | jq

```

This command will fetch the SBOM assigned to the latest tag by default. You can also specify the tag you'd like to fetch the SBOM from.

You can also use the cosign verify-attestation command to check the signature of an SBOM:

```

cosign verify-attestation public.ecr.aws/t4s8c0c3/kubectl \
  --type https://spdx.dev/Document --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  --certificate-identity https://github.com/initializ/secure-images/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/heads/main

```

And you should get output that verifies the SBOM signature in cosignâ€™s transparency log:

```
Verification for public.ecr.aws/t4s8c0c3/kubectl --
The following checks were performed on each of these signatures:
  - The cosign claims were validated
  - Existence of the claims in the transparency log was verified offline
  - The code-signing certificate was verified using trusted certificate authority certificates
